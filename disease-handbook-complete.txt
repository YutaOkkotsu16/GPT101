      The New Hampshire Division of Public Health Services, Bureau of Infectious Disease
Control, prepared this manual for childcare providers and parents/guardians of children
attending childcare. The disease fact sheets, which comprise most of this document, are
intended to familiarize people with specific infectious disease problems commonly
encountered in childcare. The fact sheets can be easily photocopied for distribution to
parents and guardians.

      In the event that any of the illnesses mentioned in this manual occur among children
attending childcare, parents or guardians should be promptly notified by the childcare
provider and urged to contact their family physician to obtain specific medical care advice.

      Childcare directors should immediately notify the Bureau of Infectious Disease
Control concerning any unusual disease occurrence in their facilities so that appropriate
disease-control measures may begin promptly. To contact the Bureau of Infectious Disease
Control call (603) 271- 4496.

Fever is defined as an elevation of body
temperature above normal. The presence of fever
alone has little relevance to the spread of disease
and may or may not preclude a child’s
participation in childcare. The height of the fever
does not necessarily indicate the severity of the
child’s illness. A child’s over-exertion in a hot,
dry climate may produce a fever. Life-threatening
diseases, such as meningitis, cause a small
proportion of childhood illness with fever.
Generally, young infants show less fever with
serious illness than older children. Infants and
children older than 4 months should be excluded
whenever behavior changes and/or signs or
symptoms of illness accompany fever. Infants 4
months old or younger should be excluded when
rectal temperature is 101 F or above, or axillary
(i.e., armpit) temperature is 100 F or above, even
if there has not been a change in their behavior.

It is unreasonable and inappropriate for childcare
staff to attempt to determine which illnesses with
fevers may be serious. The child’s parents or
legal guardians, with the help of their child’s
healthcare provider, are responsible for these
decisions; therefore, parents should be informed
promptly when their child is found to have a fever
while attending childcare.

                                       Child Abuse

        The NH Division for Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) is dedicated to assisting families in
the protection, development, permanency and well being of their children and the communities in
which they live. Child protection and family support services are provided by Child Protective Service
Workers (CPSWs) in 12 District Offices throughout New Hampshire. Under certain circumstances,
DCYF also provides voluntary services to families that request them. These are available to families
that have not had a finding of abuse or neglect.

       DCYF strives to protect children from abuse and neglect and to help families nurture their
children into physically and emotionally healthy adults. The prevention and identification of child
abuse and neglect is a community responsibility that depends on the cooperation of all community
members. In situations where abuse, neglect or sexual abuse is suspected or if discussion with the
family does not relieve concerns, then the Division for Children, Youth and Families should be
contacted at 603-271-6562 or 1-800-894-5533 (In state only) 24 hours per day.

        If you suspect that a child is being abused or neglected, NH state law requires that you report
your concerns to the DCYF Central Intake Unit immediately. Proof of abuse or neglect is not required
before reporting. Early reporting often prevents greater harm to children and other family members.
The same law that requires reporting (RSA 169-C) also states that any person who makes a report in
good faith is immune from any civil or criminal liability. It is better to make your concerns known
than to remain silent and possibly allow a child to be seriously harmed.

Step 6: Wash the child’s hands and return the            http://cfoc.nrckids.org/
child to a supervised area.
    a) Use soap and water, no less than 60 degrees
        F and no more than 120 degrees F, at a sink
        to wash the child’s hands, if you can.
    b) If the child is too heavy to hold for hand
        washing or cannot stand at the sink, use
        commercial disposable diaper wipes or
        follow this procedure:
           I. Wipe the child’s hands with a damp
              paper towel moistened with a drop of
              liquid soap;
          II. Wipe the child’s hands with a paper
              towel wet with clear water;
         III. Dry the child’s hands with a paper
              towel.

Step 7: Clean and sanitize the diaper-changing
surface.
   a) Dispose of the disposable paper liner used
         on the diaper changing surface in a plastic-
         lined, hands-free covered can;
   b) Clean any visible soil from the changing
         surface with detergent and water; rinse
         with water.
   c) Wet the entire changing surface with the
         sanitizing solution (e.g., spray a sanitizing
         bleach solution of ¼ cup of household
         liquid chlorine bleach in one gallon of tap
         water, mixed fresh daily);
   d) Put away the spray bottle of sanitizer. If the
         recommended bleach dilution is sprayed as
         a sanitizer on the surface, leave it in
         contact with the surface for at least two (2)
         minutes. The surface can be left to air dry
         or can be wiped dry after two (2) minutes
         of contact with the bleach solution.

Step 8:    Wash your hands using proper
technique.

                                            RASHES

       Rashes may occur for many reasons and it is impossible to cover in this manual all the causes for a
rash. In most cases, rashes that last for more than a day that are accompanied by fever and/or other
symptoms of illness, or rashes that develop all over the body should be referred to a physician for diagnosis
before a child returns to the childcare facility.

       Sensitive rashes that are caused from plant sensitivity such as poison ivy, poison oak and poison
sumac often have unusually shaped blister-like sores. The fluid in these blisters is not contagious to others.
People react to direct contact from the plant or from indirect contact from clothing, or other objects
contaminated from plant contact. (A family pet can also indirectly pass this to people when its fur is
contaminated). It is best to consult a physician for treatment.

        Hives is a rash that may happen when a person is hypersensitive to such things as certain foods,
drugs, and bee stings. It may also be due to emotional factors. The rash is usually itchy, raised, reddish
welts on the skin. Hives that are accompanied by difficulty breathing, unusual anxiety and hives occurring
all over the body needs to be seen by a physician immediately.

        Another common rash experienced by children during the summer months is known as Swimmer’s
Itch. It is a form of dermatitis (i.e., inflammation of the skin) that is caused by larvae of certain worms
when they attempt to penetrate the skin. This results in a mild allergic reaction. The worms that cause
Swimmer’s itch are commonly found in water after being excreted from birds, waterfowl and mammals.
Generally, no treatment is required for the rash since it goes away in a few days and does not cause lasting

              CHICKENPOX (VARICELLA) AND

chickenpox. New Hampshire currently requires            4496
varicella vaccination for school or daycare
attendance. The two dose series should be
completed at 12-15 months and again at 4-6 years.

The ACIP also recommends that daycare workers,
who have no history of chickenpox disease, be
tested for immunity. If testing shows susceptibility,
2 doses of varicella vaccine should be administered
separated by one month.

Each childcare facility should have a system so that
it is notified if a child or staff member develops
chickenpox or shingles. This is so the facility may
take appropriate measures if there is a pregnant or
immunocompromised member in the facility.
(Recently      the    Advisory     Committee     on
Immunization Practice has recommended the use of
varicella vaccine for susceptible persons who have
been exposed to varicella).

The childcare facility should watch closely for early
signs of chickenpox in other children for three
weeks following the most recent case. If a child or
staff member develops a suspicious rash, he/she
should be sent to his/her healthcare provider so that
the rash can be diagnosed. However, chickenpox is
highly contagious and in spite of your best efforts,
you will probably have several more cases if
children have not already had the disease.

Who should be excluded?
Children should be excluded from daycare after the
rash eruption first appears and until the vesicles
become dry and crusted over. In certain situations
exposed unvaccinated children without symptoms
do need to stay at home. Generally exposed
children, who have been vaccinated, do not need to
stay at home. Adults with shingles should be
excluded if vesicles/blisters cannot be covered.

How is it spread?
The virus that causes Fifth disease has been found
in the respiratory secretions of patients and is,
therefore, most likely spread by direct person-to-
person contact through the respiratory route.

ticks that may remain on clothing. Perform tick
checks after being outdoors. Early removal of
ticks can reduce the risk of infection. If a tick is
attached to the skin for less than 24 hours, the
chance of getting Lyme disease is extremely
small. Landscaping to reduce tick habitats and
prevent deer and rodents around the home may be
helpful.

How should a tick be removed?
To remove an attached tick, grasp it with one of
the tick-removal tools found in stores or fine-
tipped tweezers as close as possible to the
attachment site (i.e., skin) and pull upward and
out with a firm and steady pressure.

Do not handle the tick with bare hands, if using
your fingers to remove a tick be sure to use a
disposable towel when removing the tick. Be
careful not to squeeze, crush, or puncture the body
of the tick, which may contain infectious fluids.
After removing the tick, thoroughly cleanse the
area with an antiseptic. Seek medical attention if
there is a concern about incomplete tick removal.

Do not attempt to remove ticks by using Vaseline,
lit cigarettes, or other home remedies; doing so
may actually increase the chances of contracting a
tick-borne disease.

Who should be excluded?
Exclusion is not necessary since the disease is not
spread from person-to-person.

Reportable?
Yes.    Lyme disease is reportable by New
Hampshire law to the Division of Public Health
Services, Bureau of Infectious Disease Control at

    4. If a person develops a meningococcal
       illness, close contacts of this patient
       (including family members and person
       having intimate contact such as sleeping
       together, hugging and kissing) are at
       increased risk of developing the illness. In
       this situation, a physician or public health
       professional may recommend: 1) watching
       for early symptoms of meningococcal
       illness, and/or 2) taking a preventive
       antibiotic to eliminate the bacteria from
       the body before disease begins.
    5. Any child or adult who is a close contact
       and who develops symptoms such as fever
       or headache require prompt evaluation by
       a healthcare provider regardless of
       whether or not this person has taken the
       preventive antibiotic.
    6. Monitor the situation closely for two to
       three weeks. Make sure all ill children are
       seen by their doctors and that you are
       notified if another person develops
       meningococcal disease.
    7. Notify parents or guardians about the
       occurrence of this illness and urge them to
       contact their healthcare provider for
       specific medical advice.

Who gets this disease?
Today, polio cases occur mainly among
unimmunized young children or among members
of groups that refuse immunization.

How is it spread?
The virus is spread by direct contact with infected
stool and throat secretions. Infected persons are
most contagious during 7-10 days before and after
onset of symptoms.

What are the symptoms?
The illness ranges in severity from a mild,
unnoticed febrile illness to meningitis (an
inflammation of the covering of the brain and
spinal cord), to paralysis and even death.

How can the spread of this disease be
prevented?
Two types of polio vaccine have been available:
trivalent oral polio vaccine (TOPV) and
inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). The national
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) recommends four doses of polio vaccine.
The four dose series should be completed at 2
months, 4 months, 6-18 months, and 4-6 years.
The vaccine is required for both childcare and
school attendance.

Who should be excluded?
Children and staff should be excluded during the
acute phase of illness.

What are the symptoms?
Roseola usually begins with a high fever that lasts
3 to 5 days followed by a rash that lasts 1-2 days.
When the fever disappears, a rash appears, usually
on the face and body. Irritability, runny nose,
eyelid swelling and tiredness are sometimes
present during the time of the fever. Most
children, however, are alert and playful during
this time.

How is it diagnosed and treated?
While Roseola can be diagnosed through
laboratory conformation, a healthcare provider
typically diagnoses the disease based on the
symptoms. A rash occurring immediately after
the fever breaks is characteristic of the disease.

The infection can be spread by direct contact with
nasal or oral secretions from the infected person.
Activities such as kissing the face of a child or
coming into contact with surfaces that have been
infected with secretions and then rubbing the eyes

winter and early spring.

What is the incubation period for RSV?
The incubation period can range from 2 - 8 days
but is usually 4 - 6 days.

How can Tetanus be prevented?
The Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP) recommends immunizing
children against tetanus – along with diphtheria
and pertussis – beginning as early as six weeks of
age. The diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis
(DTaP) vaccine is required for both childcare
and school attendance. The five dose series should
be completed at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months,
and 15-18 months, and 4-6 years of age
